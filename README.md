#### RULES OF THE GAME

Battleship or Sea Battle is a war-themed board game for two players in which the opponents try to guess the location of their opponent's warships and sink them. The gameplay is straightforward. Each player hides ships on a grid containing vertical and horizontal space coordinates. Players take turns calling out row and column coordinates on the other player's grid in an attempt to identify a square that contains a ship. The game board each player gets has two grids: an upper and lower grid. The lower grid is used by the player to "hide" the location of his own ships, while the upper grid is used to record the shots fired toward the opponent and to document whether those shots were hits or misses.
